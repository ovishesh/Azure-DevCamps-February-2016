# Create an ASP.NET API app in Azure App Service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-api-v2-note](../../includes/app-service-api-v2-note.md)]

## Overview

This tutorial shows how to create an ASP.NET Web API project that is configured for deployment to the cloud as an [API app in Azure App Service](app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform.md). For information about how to configure an existing Web API project for deployment as an API app, see [Configure a Web API project as an API app](app-service-dotnet-create-api-app-visual-studio.md).

This is a quick and simple tutorial that only shows how to create a Visual Studio project using a template.  It is the first in a series that also shows how to [deploy](app-service-dotnet-deploy-api-app.md) and [debug](../app-service-dotnet-remotely-debug-api-app.md) the API app project that you create in this tutorial. For more in-depth coverage of how to work with API apps, see the [Next steps](#next-steps) section at the end of the tutorial.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [install-sdk-2015-2013](../../includes/install-sdk-2015-2013.md)]

This tutorial requires version 2.6 or later of the Azure SDK for .NET.

## Next steps

Your API app is now ready to be deployed, and you can follow the [Deploy an API app](app-service-dotnet-deploy-api-app.md) tutorial to do that.
